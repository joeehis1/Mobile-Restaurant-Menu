# Mobile-Restaurant-Menu
 Mobile Restaurant menu solo project. 

This project was built as a means to further practise using the dataset attribute as a means of selecting DOM elements. All functionality is done using classes to keep the main Javascript code clean and to separate the configuration details from main app.
